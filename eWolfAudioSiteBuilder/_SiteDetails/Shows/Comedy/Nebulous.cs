            Description = "Set in the year 2099, the series depicts the Earth as very different from today. " +
                "Following a number of environmental disasters, such as \"the Withering\" – which resulted in the loss " +
                "of a great deal of human knowledge including the vacuum cleaner and fire (although the latter came " +
                "back fairly quickly) – and a \"Cattle-clasm\" that killed off most of the livestock, the Earth has " +
                "been reduced to a wasteland separated between \"Withered Zones\" and the remaining inhabitable areas. " +
                "The Withering shifted the Earth into a new orbit, resulting in disruption to the seasons and a reformed " +
                "calendar. Every day of the week is now 25 hours long except for Thursday (which, due to time " +
                "anomalies, has not occurred in over a decade), while the change in the length of the year " +
                "led to the creation of new months such as Janril, Febtober, and Marchuary.";
